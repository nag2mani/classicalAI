This repository is for storing code and datasets for various problems related to Classical AI.

First Assignment: Create a Connected real life graph and apply DFS, BFS, A-Star, and Greedy-best- first search on five different input.

There are following files and their working:
1. CityGraph : It is a folder which contain files related to graph from which i have extracted adjacency list.
2. a_star : It conatin A-Star algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
3. dfs : It conatin dfs algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
4. bfs : It conatin bfs algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
5. greedy_bfs : It conatin Greedy best first algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
6. image.png : It is image of a tree which i have used initially for bfs abd dfs.
7. Analysis.txt : It contain explicit analysis of all four algorithms with their pros and cons.


Second Assignment:
1. Write a python code to implement the Mini-Max algorithm for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This code should compute the minimax values of the entire game tree starting from the initial blank state. Write the minimax values to a json file (or any other suitable format) after the training. Think of techniques you can use to reduce the size of this file.
2. Write a python code that uses the output of #1 (from the json file) to play the game against a human player.
3. (optional) Repeat #1 and #2 for Alpha-Beta pruning and compare its efficiency with the Mini-Max algorithm.


Third Assignment:
1. Write a python code to implement the Reinforcement Learning algorithm for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This code should iterate over the game tree several times to learn the value for each state. You need to analyse how the state values change over time. Do they reach some kind of saturation? If not, when is a good time to stop the iterations? Feel free to search the web for blogs on this topic, but do not copy the code. Write the learnt values to a json file (or any other suitable format) after the training.
2. Write a python code that uses the output of #1 (from the json file) to play the game against a human player.
3. Compare the efficacy of AI game play against a human player using Mini-Max and Reinforcement Learning.
4. (optional) Create a GUI for playing the game using Mini-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning and Reinforcement Learning.
