This repository is for storing code and datasets for various problems related to Classical AI.

First Assignment: Create a Connected real life graph and apply DFS, BFS, A-Star, and Greedy-best- first search on five different input.

There are following files and their working:
1. CityGraph : It is a folder which contain files related to graph from which i have extracted adjacency list.
2. a_star : It conatin A-Star algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
3. dfs : It conatin dfs algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
4. bfs : It conatin bfs algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
5. greedy_bfs : It conatin Greedy best first algorithm and their analysis on 5 diffrent pairs of node.
6. image.png : It is image of a tree which i have used initially for bfs abd dfs.
7. Analysis.txt : It contain explicit analysis of all four algorithms with their pros and cons.


Second Assignment:
